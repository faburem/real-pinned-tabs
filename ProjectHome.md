This extension pretty much ports back the --pinned-tab-count feature that has been removed from Chrome back in 2010 as an extension ([issue 37596](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37596)). You can define an unlimited number of tabs which are always loaded pinned on startup. While this feature has been partly implemented by the out of the box setting "On startup > Continue were I left off." this comes with one drawback - only the pinned tabs of the last closed window will be saved/restored.

At this time the settings dialog is held really simple, but more features are planned to be added soon.

News: Version 3.0 is here - and it supports URL wildcards now!
